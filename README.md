Vahid Font is a multilingual typeface for my own needs with support for wide range of scripts, including **English**, **Turkish**, **Ottoman**, **Azerbaijani**, **Persian**, **Arabic**, and other **Latin** and **Arabic-based scripts**. based on ArefRuqaa, Vahid Font includes extensive modifications to enhance support for Turkish, Azerbaijani, and specially Ottoman characters

## Features

- **Customized Glyphs**: Tailored modifications for Turkish and Azerbaijani characters (e.g. İ, ş, ğ and ə) and historical Ottoman script.
