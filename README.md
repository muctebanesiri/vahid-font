Vahid Font is a multilingual typeface for my daily personal use, supporting a wide range of scripts, including English, Turkish, Ottoman, Azerbaijani, Persian, Arabic, and other Latin and Arabic-based scripts. Based on ArefRuqaa, Vahid Font includes extensive modifications to enhance support for Turkish, Azerbaijani, and Ottoman characters.

## Features

- **Multilingual Support**: Covers English, Turkish, Ottoman, Azerbaijani, Persian, Arabic, and other Latin and Arabic-based scripts.
- **Customized Glyphs**: Tailored modifications for Turkish and Azerbaijani characters (e.g. İ, ş, ğ and ə) and Ottoman script.
- **Dual-Script Design**: Combines the Ruqaa for Arabic scripts with AMS Euler for Latin scripts.
- **OpenType Format**: Provided as `Vahid.otf` for broad compatibility across platforms.

## Preview

Below is a sample of how Vahid Font renders various scripts:
